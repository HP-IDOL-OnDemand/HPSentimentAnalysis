DESCRIPTION
===========

VerticaConnection provides a library to connect and query a Vertica database using Vertica's jdbc driver. 

SOURCE DESCRIPTION
==================

`Vertica` is the class that creates the data source, connects with Vertica and performs the queries.

It uses Spring's SimpleDriverDataSource to establish the connection and Spring's JdbcTemplate to query the database.
 
ADDITIONAL DIRECTORIES
======================

This project includes three additional directories:

- `libs`    includes the Vertica JDBC driver.
- `scripts` includes a bash script to take the output generated by TwitterCollect and IdolSentimentAnalysis and
            generate tbl files to populate the database. It also includes scripts to create the database and load 
            it with data.This sql scripts must be run directly in the Vertica server. This directory is include
            in the installation distribution when running `gradle installApp`
- `db`      includes sample tbl files to populate the database. This directory is include in the installation
            distribution when running `gradle installApp`

scripts/extract_tbl_files.bash
------------------------------

This script receives the input files generated by TwitterCollect and IdolSentimentAnalysis as arguments and generates
two files:

- tweet.tbl contains the rows to be inserted in the tweet table.
- sentiment.tbl contains the rows to be inserted in the sentiment table.

Example run: `scripts/extract_tbl_files tweet.out sentiment.out`

scripts/*.sql
-------------

These scripts must be run from the Vertica server to create the database and load it with data provided from tbl files
generated by `extract_tbl_files.bash`. Before loading, verify that the filename references for the tbl files in 
`load_data.sql` are correct.
